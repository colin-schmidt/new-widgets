        , React is:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Declarative:</strong> React makes it painless to create
            interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your
            application, and React will efficiently update and render just the
            right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your
            code more predictable and easier to debug.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Component-Based:</strong> Build encapsulated components that
            manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since
            component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you
            can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the
            DOM.

        </ul>
